<h2 align="center"> Short Articles Series </h2>

A creative idea for PCB art design.

I made this PCB Keychain using the *EasyEDA* software and then ordered it online at [*JLCPCB*](https://jlcpcb.com/IRG)

You can order the fabrication according to your preferences of color, thickness, PCB material and more.
